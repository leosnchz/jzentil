Create WordPress posts from Vimeo videos complete with video embed, title, description and featured image. 

== Description ==

**Vimeo Video Post** is a Vimeo WordPress plugin that allows quick importing of Vimeo videos as WordPress posts with attached video player from channels, albums, user, groups or categories. Posts are creating having all details from Vimeo (title, description, video etc).

A demonstration on how easy it is to use this Vimeo WordPress plugin:

http://vimeo.com/70033244

The plugin allows importing of single videos (needs only video ID to fill title and description and attach the video) or bulk imports from Vimeo feeds (channels, albums, etc). Bulk importing can be done manually or automatically and importing of details is made according to your settings (ie. description can be imported as post excerpt and/or content).
Please note that before being able to perform bulk imports, you need to [register the plugin](https://developer.vimeo.com/apps/new "register Vimeo app") as an app on Vimeo (requires a valid Vimeo account). 


After importing, all videos can be embedded into posts using a visual interface that creates and places the shortcode into your post/page content. Available shortcodes are for single videos as well as video playlists.

== Installation ==

Like any other plugin, it can be installed manually or directly from WordPress installation Plugins page. 

Once activated a new menu entry will be created called **Videos** (look for the Vimeo logo).

In order to be able to perform bulk imports, you will first need to register the plugin as an app on Vimeo website. Registration can be made [here](https://developer.vimeo.com/apps/new "register Vimeo app"). Please note that you must have a Vimeo account before you can register the app.
After successfull registration, go to plugin page **Settings** and under **Vimeo authentication** enter your consumer and secret key provided by Vimeo. Now you can make bulk imports.

That's  all, enjoy.
